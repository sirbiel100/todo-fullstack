## My process

### Built with

- SCSS custom properties

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Postgres' Database

### What I learned

This challenge was one of the challenges I most learned with, it was my first time building a fullstack application alone. I learned a lot of backend and database management.


### Continued development

I intend to continue developing some fullstacks applcation to have a better view about coding.
